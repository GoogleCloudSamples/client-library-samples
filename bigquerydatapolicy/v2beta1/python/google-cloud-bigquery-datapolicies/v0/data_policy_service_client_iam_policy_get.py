    Gets the IAM policy for a specific data policy.

    This sample demonstrates how to retrieve the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
    policy associated with a BigQuery data policy. The IAM policy defines who has
    what permissions on the data policy resource, allowing you to control access
    to sensitive data governed by the policy.

    Args:
        project_id: The ID of the Google Cloud project.
        location: The BigQuery location (e.g., "us-central1").
        data_policy_id: The ID of the data policy.

    # or use a context manager (`with client:`) to ensure proper resource cleanup.
