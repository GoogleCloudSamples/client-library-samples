    "narrative": "This sample shows the initial step for streaming data into BigQuery using the Storage Write API. A developer must first create a write stream, which acts as a connection for sending data records. This is a foundational part of real-time data ingestion pipelines, such as those for logs or event data, and offers lower latency than traditional batch loading jobs.",
